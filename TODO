Possible to do any customization of the editorâ€¦

    which buttons are there (e.g. can we get rid of the image button?)
    where they are (e.g. can we put them all above or below the canvas, not beside it to save space?)
    can we not have the scrolly feature where the canvas moves when you move your mouse around?, 
    etc

Can we control the canvas size?  Looks like it is defaulting to 640 x 480.
Can we turn the rulers on and off?
